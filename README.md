# PyWBGT_analytic
This repository introduces an analytic approximation of the WBGT model developed by Liljegren et al (2008) for calculating wet-bulb temperature using the Davies-Jones (2008) approach. This approximation doesn't require iteration while maintaining high accuracy and most of the physics of Liljegren's model.
